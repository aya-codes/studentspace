Matching Features
    Match preference weights (e.g., users can mark topics as ‚Äúpriority‚Äù)
    Fallback matching (if no one with the same topic is available, suggest nearby topics)
    Matching queue with timeout (if a user waits too long, auto-match them)

Safety & Trust
    Report/block system
    Anonymity toggle
    One-time-use chatrooms or expiration timers

Chatroom Upgrades
    Chatroom IDs returned in response
    In-memory chat vs persistent chat (store messages in DB)
    Typing indicators / "user joined" notifications

Admin & Maintenance
    Room cleanup job (remove empty/inactive rooms)
    Log who matched with whom and when (for audit)
    Metrics (e.g. how many matches per day, average wait time)

Developer Enhancements
    Use @Builder or constructors for DTOs to reduce boilerplate
    Add @Slf4j and use structured logging for traceability
    Add Swagger/OpenAPI for auto-documenting your API

üõ°Ô∏è TESTS TO WRITE

1. Unit Tests (Logic-Level)
Make sure to write JUnit tests for:
    Matching logic (e.g., pairing based on topic or other rules)
    Room creation and user joining
    Enum parsing (e.g. Topic.valueOf(...))
    Edge cases like null input, duplicate usernames, or empty rooms

2. Integration Tests (Spring Boot Test)
Use @SpringBootTest to simulate real request flows:
    POST to /match ‚Üí user gets added to a room
    Matching multiple users with the same topic
    Matching users with different topics ‚Üí new rooms created
    Concurrent requests (simulate race conditions)

3. Manual Testing with Postman
Try:
    Valid and invalid enum values
    Missing fields
    Duplicate users
    Timing how long until users get matched
    Sending a request without a body (or with invalid JSON)

4. Bug Patterns to Watch Out For
    NullPointerException from uninitialized fields (like you had earlier with users)
    Shared mutable state (e.g., same Chatroom being used unsafely in multiple threads)
    Case sensitivity with enums ("friends" vs "FRIENDS")
    Stale rooms that never get cleaned up
    Time-based bugs (e.g. using LocalDateTime.now() inconsistently)
